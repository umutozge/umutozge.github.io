I study natural language understanding by humans and machines,
using techniques involving logic and programming.
The technical names of these areas are formal and computational semantics.

We have an emerging lab under Informatics Institute: [Laboratory for Formal and Computational Semantics](http://lfcs.ii.metu.edu.tr)
